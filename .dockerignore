# This file filters what gets sent to the Docker daemon as build context during
# image builds, improving build performance.
#
# Impact:
# - Volume mounts: NOT affected (dev/frankenphp/build get full project access at runtime)
# - COPY commands: Files/dirs listed here cannot be copied (build would fail)
#
# The entries below are safe because no Dockerfile tries to COPY them. They significantly
# speed up builds by excluding large directories (node_modules, vendor, .git).

# Developer files
.git
.github
.idea
.vscode

# Database, provided zips and original images
*.accdb
*.zip
images

# Local dev dependencies and scripts
*.phar
node_modules
vendor

# Temporary files
.php-cs-fixer.cache
.phpunit.result.cache
test-results
tmp/github
